<p><strong>ProximaX Sirius Platform Architecture</strong>
As a blockchain-based infrastructure solution provider, ProximaX's core offering is the ProximaX Sirius platform, available for both private/permissioned and public offerings. It combines blockchain protocol with off-chain and distributed storage, streaming, and database service layers that are often found in traditional software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) architectures, in turn creating a wholistic platform for enterprise grade applications.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/04/Sirius-Platform-final.png" alt="Sirius-Platform-final" />
<strong>ProximaX Sirius' Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Fundamentally, the distributed ledger technology or blockchain layer of ProximaX Sirius forms the heart of the platform. This blockchain layer serves as a bridge that connects the storage layer, streaming layer and database layer. Together, these layers are interlinked to the “centre” of the network, establishing a well-balanced ecosystem within the platform to carry out “identification via namespace, statistics/reporting via transactions, and incentivisations” that are fields in the “predefined smart contracts” as explained in the <a href="https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/yfTko5PfyyN9K5N#pdfviewer">“High-level Technical Whitepaper"</a>.</p>
<p>As a state of the art technology, the muscles of the blockchain layer is found in the onboarding process, where it transmits messages to the nodes in the storage layer. As documented in the <a href="https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/mQHKn75rCg6SS25#pdfviewer">“Storage Contract Model - Traceability Requirements”</a>, the life cycle for filing a storage service begins with the Acceptor Node receiving the client’s request. Nodes and verifiers are then selected for the requested service, with part-payment made during the service while all the failed nodes and validators will be changed for better upkeep and coherence. This decentralised file management system allows users to rent disk spaces safely at competitive prices. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/bj8bHf2Smk4LHA6#pdfviewer">“Storage Tokenomics Research”</a> explains ProximaX’s file storage structure which is based on The Insertion Modeling Approach – an approach on model building and the interaction of agents and environments. In essence, modeling insertion refers to the insertion of agents into a hierarchy of environments to evolve progressively. A ripple effect is created whenever agents are “inserted” into the environment, causing a new environment to be born, allowing new agents to be “inserted” again. Further details about this shapeshifting capability is offered in the <a href="https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/af3qGePfaARiCdG#pdfviewer">“Storage Macroeconomics Model”</a> paper as it highlights the environmental and macro modeling variables used for different behaviours of each storage tokenomic scenario. </p>
<p>Akin to the storage layer, the streaming layer has different actors fitted into one node. It rides on Peerstream protocol by collaborating partner PeerStream, Inc. for real-time anonymous data streaming with very high levels of security. This security comprises four levels, at the hardware level, onion routing and two levels of state-of-the-art encryption. This provides anonymous interaction between users using blockchain as an identity storage or to stream any kind of content such as IoT, messaging, and video.</p>
<p>The database layer, only available for private/permissioned offering, consists of a technology stack that uses a document based database (MongoDB) backed by a technology called Tendermint as its blockchain enforcement mechanism. This layer is a database with blockchain properties  that has simple transfer transaction contracts, its own asset management,  and metadata storage. Like any blockchain, the database technology also runs in a decentralised manner and maintains the MongoDB as its ledger to store the chain of records identified by a hash.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits</strong>
In essence, the integration of blockchain protocol with off-chain service layers in a distributed network with manageable but distinct layers, affords the ProximaX Sirius platform solution with both the advantages of a blockchain based network, and traditional centralised database solutions.  </p>
<p>It leverages inherent blockchain features while solving the conundrum in blockchain ledger transactions of being slow and costly to scale, with limited real world utility, thus providing for flexibility, ease of adoption and integration, security and speed, and cost-efficiency - all packaged within one extensive framework.</p>
<p>The ProximaX Sirius Platform has every component needed to power entire system solutions or a standalone application, whilst substantially reducing the total cost of ownership. Users and developers are able to store and stream data of large sizes in the distributed service layers whilst transactions are conducted with speed on the blockchain to ensure security, transparency, immutability, irreversibility and traceability.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
