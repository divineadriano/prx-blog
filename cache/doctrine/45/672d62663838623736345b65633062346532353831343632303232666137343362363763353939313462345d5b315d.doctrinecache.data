However, taking such vigilant measures does not guarantee one's security or privacy as seen in the recent Facebook password fiaso <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/03/21/facebook-has-exposed-up-to-600-million-passwords-heres-what-to-do/#2b8df893bc90">(article here)</a> where it has been reported that up to 600 million passwords have been exposed. This situation is not unique to Facebook alone. In November 2018, the Marriott Hotel Group <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvolodzko/2018/12/04/marriott-breach-exposes-far-more-than-just-data/#1a03b9e66297">(article here)</a> suffered a massive data breach exposing the private details of up to 500 million of its guests worldwide.</p>
<p>These incidences, caused either by flaws in traditional computing systems or human error - in the case of Facebook, having passwords being held by Facebook itself - can be easily avoided using blockchain technology. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology where data is distributed across and managed by peer-to-peer networks, eliminates the need for a centralized authority or server to manage data and information. </p>
<p>Recognizing the urgent need for users to be in complete control of their privacy, ProximaX endevours to ensure that its users are the sole owners of their data without any compromise. To do this, ProximaX uses blockchain technology to power it applications. </p>
<p>For example, ProximaX Suite, the first-of-its-kind blockchain powered office suite deploys a blockchain asymmetric encryption technology to secure data from threats of theft and fraud that typically occur at centralised and cloud-hosted sites. This end-to-end office suite application operates from a distributed, replicated and sharded configuration making it highly superior in terms of availability, efficiency and privacy. </p>
