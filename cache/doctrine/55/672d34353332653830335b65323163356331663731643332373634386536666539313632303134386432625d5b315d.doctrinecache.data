<h2>High-level Technical Whitepaper</h2>
<p>The technical whitepaper (version 1.0) is a high-level design of the platform's solution. It tackles the technical attributes of each layer, and the approach to macromodelling and token economics. It also provides step-by-step descriptions of the platform's processes.</p>

<h2>Storage Contract Model - Traceability Requirements</h2>
<p>This document describes all possible components of the system and scenarios using  a  list  of  logically  descriptive  steps for the storage contract. It also describes how the new storage contracts are modelled to solve the cases as per specifications.</p>
<p>https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/mQHKn75rCg6SS25</p>
<h2>Storage Tokenomics Research</h2>
<p>The research describes the token economy model of the storage schema based on the business specification of the token (XPX and stable coin). </p>

<h2>Storage Macroeconomic Model</h2>
<p>This is the environment/macro modelling variables/inputs document used to simulate different behaviours of storage tokenomic scenarios.</p>
<p>https://suite-app.proximax.io/s/af3qGePfaARiCdG</p>
<h2>Upcoming Papers</h2>
<p>There will be updates to the technical whitepaper as we make further progress. In addition, we will be publishing a few papers (original work) that will tackle storage streaming and super contracts.</p>
