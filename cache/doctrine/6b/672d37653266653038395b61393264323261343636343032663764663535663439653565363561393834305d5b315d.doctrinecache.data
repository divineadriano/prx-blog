<p>Only about a week after the successful XPX token distribution to supporters, ProximaX is pleased to announce that XPX is now listed and available on <a href="https://kryptono.exchange/k/accounts/home"><strong>Kryptono</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Kryptono boasts of its speed and intuitive user graphical interface, security measures to protect users’ asset, transparency of accounting system for users to clearly see where their money is from, organized and responsive customer service, and price manipulation prevention of ill-liquid cryptos.</p>
<p>Following this listing, the ProximaX team is working to list XPX on more exchanges. The team will regularly release announcements of XPX listings in new exchanges in the coming months.</p>
