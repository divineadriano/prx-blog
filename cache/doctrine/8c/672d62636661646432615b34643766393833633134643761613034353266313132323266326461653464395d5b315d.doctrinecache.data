<p>ProximaX Vault is a password manager DApp with similar functionality to LastPass, Keepass, and Dashlane. However, unlike these conventional password manager applications, ProximaX Vault is backed by blockchain-based encryption technology where your information is encrypted and distributed across various nodes, making it impossible for anyone to access your authentication credentials without permission. This superior DApp allows you to manage and securely keep your passwords for your user accounts, whether it is on the web, on desktop applications, email addresses, and even banking. </p>
