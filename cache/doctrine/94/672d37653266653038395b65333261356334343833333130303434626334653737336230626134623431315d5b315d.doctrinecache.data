<p>Only about a week after the successful XPX token distribution to supporters, ProximaX is pleased to announce that XPX is now listed and available on <a href="https://nemchange.com/Exchange/market/prx:xpx/nem:xem"><strong>Nemchange</strong></a>. </p>
<p>Nemchange is a cryptocurrency exchange for buying and selling NEM (XEM) coins and NEM-based tokens (called Mosaics). In this platform, you can only trade XEM with other mosaics like the XPX. Although Nemchange currently does not allow non-NEM tokens and cryptocurrencies to be traded, it has plans to add support for some of the most popular ones in the near future.</p>
<p>Following this listing, the ProximaX team is working to list XPX on more exchanges. The team will regularly release announcements about XPX listings in new exchanges in the coming months.</p>
