About 40 community members came to meet ProximaX Founder and CEO, Lon Wong who talked about the ProximaX and some of the exciting developments happening with the project. </p>

<p>This was a great opportunity for members of the community to get to meet and speak to Lon personally. We were also honoured to have Miguel Caballero, CEO of Tutellus to tell us about his project which is the biggest online educational collaborative platform in the Spanish-speaking world.  </p>
<p>We would like to thank each and every member of our South Korean community who participated in the meetup with a special shout out to our community leaders who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make this all happen.  The response from the community was so positive that we will are now finalizing the dates for the next meet up!  It was a pleasure meeting our community members and we hope we will meet again in the future!</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
