a:2:{s:7:"content";s:4388:"<p>The coming together of 482.solutions and ProximaX is one that was strung together through a common vision - to deliver economic and social “points of trust, or ledgers of trust,” said Roman Kravchenko, CEO of 482.solutions, where entities can share values and digital assets in a transparent way by utilising blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The two recently met up at ProximaX’s Kuala Lumpur office in Malaysia as part of 482.solutions’ roadshow in Asia, and after having signed an MOU with ProximaX on 18 October 2018, in Singapore.</p>
<p>“We started collaborating in the summer of 2018, and in October we signed a Memorandum of Understanding to seal our cooperation in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics,” explained Roman.</p>
<p>482.solutions is an established award-winning technology company that was founded in Odessa, Ukraine in 2013. This company represents a new breed of tech developers whose objective, in addition to the above stated is also undertake “joint research and development activities to establish new use-cases and develop projects on the ProximaX platform utilising 482.solutions’ technical innovations, specifically in the areas of IoT and Robotics.”</p>

<p>Founder and CEO of ProximaX, Lon Wong highly regards the “well-rounded” 482.solutions for their appreciation of business problems and finding a solution through innovative technology to resolve them. Lon also praises 482.solutions for their ability to move with the times and evolve from being a typical web applications company to embracing blockchain technology and  quickly become a firm advocate of this innovative and disruptive technology.</p>
<p>At present, the area of focus of the two organisations is on infrastructure, whereby 482.solutions is assisting with the development of storage layer of the ProximaX Sirius platform and Software Development Kits (SDKs). 482.solutions will also contribute to develop applications that are purposeful for business. The longer roadmap between the parties entails a goal that includes formulating a crypto economy or token economy model. </p>
<p>Together, they are working out a new industry standard for smart contracts which will be called Super Contracts, where the much flawed smart contract is evolved into a practical business tool. According to Alvin Reyes, Co-founder and CTO of ProximaX, “Super Contracts are something we are doing differently compared to how smart contracts work. It is independent of blockchain but still has a consensus mechanism and relies on peer-to-peer technology. Our Super Contract is mutable, reversible and stoppable by consensus. Basically we have a lot of security against bad code (hacking, draining money etc.) or poor coding (non-functioning etc.) but there is also recourse by consensus, something that is very different and makes our solution practical for mainstream business use.”</p>
<p>As for real world use cases, the teams are busy collaborating on exciting shared economy robotics projects where this will showcase how code and software perform on ProximaX’s storage and peer-to-peer value system exchange in an all new robonomics ecosystem. </p>
<p>Both ProximaX and 482.solutions have the clear objective of building solutions based on real economy needs as opposed to building hypothetical or experimental solutions that are not really required in the real world. As Alvin puts it, “We share the same vision of creating practical tech solutions that can increase the overall efficiency of the enterprise or organization adopting this solution.” </p>
<p>At the time of writing, a “Security Exchange Files &amp; Data” app is also being tested in-house at 482.solutions to prompt file owners when their files are being modified or tampered with. Once this is ready, the solution will be offered to the public as an easy way for users to know when their data is changed.</p>
<p>Although the collaboration between 482.solutions and ProximaX is still in its infancy, the close cooperation between the two organizations has been very synergistic and is expected to further speed up the development of the ProximaX Sirius platform and use cases. </p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
