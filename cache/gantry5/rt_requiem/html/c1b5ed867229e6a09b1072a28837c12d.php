<p>ProximaX is a next-generation Integrated and Distributed Ledger Technology (“IaDLT”) infrastructure platform solution that extends beyond traditional blockchain protocols by integrating off-chain, peer-to-peer storage, streaming, and database service layers that are often found in traditional software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) centralised architectures. 
</p><p>
Together, the blockchain protocol and the off-chain service layers form the ProximaX Sirius platform, the core platform solution in the ProximaX ecosystem. The ProximaX Sirius platform solution provides both the advantages of a blockchain-based network, and traditional centralised database solutions. It leverages inherent blockchain features while solving the conundrum in blockchain ledger transactions providing for flexibility, ease of adoption and integration, security and speed, and cost-efficiency all packaged within one extensive framework. 
</p><p>
Users and developers can store and stream data of large sizes in the distributed service layers whilst transactions are conducted with speed on the blockchain to ensure security, transparency, immutability, irreversibility and traceability. ProximaX Sirius greatly expands and facilitates use cases beyond what traditional blockchain projects can do, particularly for enterprise clients.</p>
