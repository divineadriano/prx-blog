This marks the 2nd commercial deployment of ProximaX Sirius. Earlier this month, ProximaX had already deployed its first project utilizing the ProximaX Sirius platform with CashCart.io. Based on Catapult - the core NEM blockchain technology, ProximaX Sirius is a next-generation, Integrated and Distributed Ledger Technology (IaDLT). This IaDLT is an agglomeration of proven technologies which include distributed database system, distributed file management system, and blockchain. The end result in using the ProximaX solution is a substantial reduction in total cost of ownership, including time to market, and with a superior approach in application design and development.

We look forward to brining you more news on the utilization of our platform, as we continue to champion true utility of blockchain technology to enterprises globally.
