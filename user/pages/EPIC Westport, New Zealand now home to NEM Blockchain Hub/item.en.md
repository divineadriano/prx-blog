What a memorable evening it was last Wednesday, 25th July 2018, when ProximaX Founder and CEO, Lon Wong was invited to speak at the grand opening of the NEM Blockchain Hub in the lovely town of Westport, New Zealand. In his speech, Lon expressed his delight at the way NEM was blazing the way to help communities, especially ones in the more rural areas to embrace blockchain technology and create job opportunities to become centers of growth and excellence. 

Lon, who was a founding member and the first President of the [NEM.io](https://nem.io) Foundation explained that ProximaX, which is an extension of the NEM Blockchain, would endeavor to hold the hands of local industries and government in adopting blockchain technology for an array of use cases such as medical health records, land registry, car registrations, identity records and archiving.
