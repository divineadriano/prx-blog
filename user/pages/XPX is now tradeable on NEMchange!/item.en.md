Buy and trade XPX now!

Only about a week after the successful XPX token distribution to supporters, ProximaX is pleased to announce that XPX is now listed and available on [**Nemchange**](https://nemchange.com/Exchange/market/prx:xpx/nem:xem). 

Nemchange is a cryptocurrency exchange for buying and selling NEM (XEM) coins and NEM-based tokens (called Mosaics). In this platform, you can only trade XEM with other mosaics like the XPX. Although Nemchange currently does not allow non-NEM tokens and cryptocurrencies to be traded, it has plans to add support for some of the most popular ones in the near future.

Following this listing, the ProximaX team is working to list XPX on more exchanges. The team will regularly release announcements about XPX listings in new exchanges in the coming months.

Here are the links to know more and be updated about ProximaX.
